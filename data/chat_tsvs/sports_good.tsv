o	alright alright alright y'all, GET HYPE because we here to talk about SPORTS!	
o	:confetti: :siren: :sparkles:	
	whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo	
	YEA BOI	
o	i know this won't be the most popular thread hereabouts. hey, newtopians are nerds (which is obviously just as it should be!), and nerdy subcultures tend not to be all that into the sportsball.	
a	hey now, no pigeonholing! <-- proud nerd and lebron james SUPERFAN over here :heart-eyes: :basketball: :dog-panting:	
o	but i wanna get us going with a couple key opening ???s we gotta get on the same page about. first up: why do sports even matter here in newtopia? and second: what are we talking about, really, when we talk about "sports?"	
o	and yeah <username_a>, you right, sorry for thinking small about the kinds of stuff nerds be into!	
	:spectacles: :baseball:	
	i'm so happy to be here with you, /3/sports fam! OMG WAIT, we should make special username badges for our favorite teams!!!	
	^ this person knows what is UP, can i get a cleveland browns badge please??	
	aight y'all, pm <username_badges> and i'll organize a group to get that going :)	
	:airhorn: democracy in action right HERE woot woot	
b	ok but, <username_o>, i think the problem wasn't actually that you were thinking small about nerds' interests. or, maybe you were, but let's be real: nerds don't really care about american football or nascar. the real issue is that, to pick up your first key question, you were thinking small about "sports."	
	:thinking-face: hmm say more?	
c	yeah peeps, i gotta say i'm disappointed that we're 15+ messages into this thread and nobody has even MENTIONED e-sports yet! WTF, i didn't expect to find any bullshit "e-sports aren't real sports* bias HERE of all places :angry:	
	e-sports are real sports and i will fight anybody who says otherwise :pointing-finger:	
	whoa whoa, calm down y'all, i don't think anyone's saying that e-sports aren't real sports...?	
d	yeah dudes (or dudettes i guess, but let's be real...) - ain't nobody dissing your precious DOTA here. although i gotta say, given the kinda peeps i'm picturing you being, i'm p amused by the image of y'all fighting your way out of a wet paper bag, so maybe keep on bein mad for the sake of the thread? :joy:	
	^ oooooh sick burn	
	^ oooooh problematic gender and interest-based stereotypes	
d	:embarrassed: sorry, totally true!	
c	:tongue-stuck-out:	
b	look y'all, i gotta admit i wasn't even thinking about e-sports, but obviously that was silly. i guess i wonder if we should just make a whole entirely separate thread for e-sports...?	
c	what is that, some separate but equal shit?	
b	naw, just thinking that the people who love e-sports and the people who love traditional sports might actually be so different that it'll be hard to have either conversation successfully if we're all talking together.	
c	yeah. that's probably true actually. aight y'all, i'm out, see you over at /3/esports	
	don't you mean /3/futuresports? :troll-face:	
b	anyway - i was more thinking about one of my favorite things from the old world - First Robotics. y'all ever seen how amazing that shit is?	
	OMG YES I LOVE FIRST!!! :garnet-dance:	
b	first robotics is an annual...competition? sporting event? well - i think we should call it a sporting event. the specific rules change every year, but it's always a time-based game that involves scoring points in one of several ways via building and then remotely operating a mechanical robot.	
	ohhhh, that sounds dope! it's like a sport, but it's more inclusive, because anybody can play, not just people with crazy physical gifts.	
y	^ yeah i mean, better to say, "not just abled-bodied people" even, right?	
	omg of course you're right, i'm so sorry to any differently abled people on this thread, i swear i see you and value you! :cry: :see-no-evil:	
	there, there, it's ok, everyone makes little mistakes...	
y	as a differently abled person, i'm glad to see that kind of apology, because it approximates the kind of injury i feel minute by minute in this conversation that isn't really about or for me. :(	
	awww. i'm sorry :hug: newtopia isn't perfect yet, but we'll get there!	
	yeah, and in order to get there, sometimes people might just need a little public shaming. you know, to make sure the point gets across. it's for the greater cultural good yo	
	ok but wait a minute - it's good to talk about differently abled people being able to participate in sports and all, but shouldn't we be talking about differently wealthy people? last time i checked it was expensive to build robots??	
	yeah, and this is one of the problems with first IRL, right? the teams from the fanciest schools always clean house	
b	it's true - first isn't perfect. but don't discount the benefit for kids of just competing at all, even on a last-place team! it can foster a lifelong love of learning and competition. plus, in newtopia, WE CAN DO BETTER! we'll come up with rules to specify the kinds of materials and tools that can be used, and we'll subsidize the teams from poorer areas, to level the playing field. :muscle:	
	yayyyyy I LOVE THIS! 	
	whooooo hell yeah y'all, we on a roll!	
	cool cool cool, this is great stuff, thanks <username_b>. i'm a lil worried tho that we mebbe put the cart before the horse or w/e. i'm here because i love sports and all, been a die hard boston sports fan my whole life (RED SOX FOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS IN FIFTEEN YEARS BABYYYYYYYYYY) but like, i don't think i have a super great answer to <username_o>'s second question here - when it really comes down to it, why do we gotta have sports at all? if i'm lookin in the mirror and being real real, sports fans aren't always so good to each other. :/	
	yeah this ^ is what i wanted to come and say too. are we sure this is a good idea? remember how every major sporting venue has metal detectors these days, and fans of rival teams beat each other up all the time?	
e	look, folks: we're all here to build newtopia, which means we're all obviously optimists. a better world is possible, etc. etc. but we're only gonna get where we wanna be if we're able to be _realistic_ with ourselves about hard shit. and we're up against one particularly bad problem with this whole endeavor, which is *~* human nature *~*	
	human nature, spookiest nature :anguish: :ghost:	
e	we can try to change culture with better education, and we can build stronger community support networks, and we can do it all well and thoughtfully. but *people will still be people.* and that means a few big things are just never gonna change, starting with my very "favorite" piece of human psychology, good old ingroup/outgroup.	
	hmmmmm. i see where you're going here. i guess i'm with it.	
e	let me propose to you that sports have always, in essentially every culture, era, and season of history, served as a way to help the masses _channel their need for inter-group conflict_ into a relatively "safe" form - which has generally meant, at least it's not literal war!	
	oof #laughcry	
e	given the past ten years of US politics, i think it'll pass unchallenged for me to assert that ingroup/outgroup is alive and kicking strong in the modern human psyche. it's an ugly truth, but there it is. let's embrace it and work with it!	
	:applause: great point friendo	
	^ this (wo)man gets it right here	
	beautifully articulated! let's make a newtopian governing committee for our sports, right? it can be a body that helps us design the right mix of games, event types, and competitive structures to help people get invested in this stuff in healthy ways! which includes completely and totally dominating the competition while still consistently respecting them OBVIOUSLY	
	yesssss so into this. how can i sign up to help?
