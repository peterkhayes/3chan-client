	crypto is the futureeeeeeeee	
	when my mom doesn't get why crypto is so great I just ask her what time her bank closes, and when she says 5:00 I get to say, "You know when the blockchain closes, Mom? Never."	
	dude that is a great argument, stealing it	
	cryptocurrency is 24/7/365	
	Yeah sure, but more importantly it's a geopolitical hedge	
	and a distributed database	
a	Clear disadvantages of fiat currency (aka why we need blockchain to be more widespread yesterday):	
a	1) Gov'ts are incentivized to print more, resulting in inflation	
a	2) Any centralized fiat currency can drop to zero value and destory a nation	
	somebody go back to 2008 Iceland and spread the news	
	Anybody heard of any cool new blockchain projects lately?	
	I heard MIT is verifying graduations on the blockchain now	
	^ nice1	
	Oh! Isn't there that libertarian settlement in South America that only accepts BTC for buying plots of land? But I guess that's not blockchain....sorry	
	wow that sounds dope though, can I get deets?	
	It was called Galt's Gulch iirc	
	Oh shit, Galt's Gulch? Didn't that fall apart because it turned out the leader was a shitbag? :grimmace:	
	i can't wait until i can get my coffee maker running on the blockchain. think about it - i can never drink too much because i have to mine the next block before every cup.	
	dude how much coffee do u drink rn	
	:zombie-with-coffee-cup:	
	So now that ETH has dropped to ~$200 I'm thinking of going all in - thoughts?	
	Just remember, as Vitalik himself says--crypto is about the applications, not about the price. ETH has value as a technology, but its value as a currency is speculative.	
	Yeah, I'd say, take any crypto investment as a risky one, and just like any other investment, don't put up what you're terrified to lose	
	But like we're all clear it's going up right	
	I bought in at $500 and I am HODLing all the way up to $500k amirite	
	I'm so excited for smart contracts. Imagine it--I can buy a house with my future millions without ever having to talk to a realtor	
	shit, did you guys see about the Poloniex data breach?	
	dude, you really gotta get off Polo	
	Kraken all the way	
	Security PSA everyone: get a hardware wallet. Seriously. Get one right now.	
	^ this, very very this	
	I love my Ledger Nano S	
	Industries are going to be REVOLUTIONIZED by blockchain technology, and this is just the beginning. We're coming up on a 4th Industrial Revolution.	
	Only about 1 in every 1,000 people are involved in the crypto space right now. Imagine getting in on Facebook at that stage....	
	$$$$$	
	lol do you think when we hit full adoption Satoshi will stream himself grilling ribs with sweet baby ray's	
	lolololol	
	:high-five:	
	hey look at this ethereum watercolor i painted do you like it	https://i.imgur.com/SrzCRJI.jpg
	Love it. I'd hang that in my house.	
	Milestone you guys! >1M ETH transactions in the past 24 hours!	
	:champagne:	
	eff yes	
	I can't wait for the next milestone of 10M as it will have required some substantial scaling improvements. Perhaps stateless clients and miner network optimization will get us there.
