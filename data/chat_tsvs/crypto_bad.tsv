	crypto is the futureeeeeeeee	
	when my mom doesn't get why crypto is so great I just ask her what time her bank closes, and when she says 5:00 I get to say, "You know when the blockchain closes, Mom? Never."	
	dude that is a great argument, stealing it

	cryptocurrency is 24/7/365	
	i can't wait until i can get my coffee maker running on the blockchain. think about it - i can never drink too much because i have to mine the next block before every cup.

	So now that ETH has dropped to ~$200 I'm thinking of going all in - thoughts?	
	Just remember, as Vitalik himself says--crypto is about the applications, not about the price. ETH has value as a technology, but its value as a currency is speculative.	
	Do it!!! all of your money--so worth it. 	
	dude that's terrible advice	
	why is that terrible advice?? I'm all in	
	That's your choice - just saying, we all believe in blockchain technology here, but the cryptos themselves are a risky, volatile investment and very well could leave someone bankrupt	
	dude whatever, if you don't think cryptos are going up then what are you even doing here	
	I agree, take any crypto investment as a risky one, and just like any other investment, don't put up what you're terrified to lose	
	But like we're all clear it's going up right	
	I bought in at $500 and I am HODLing all the way up to $500k amirite	
	I'm so excited for smart contracts. Imagine it--I can buy a house with my future millions without ever having to talk to a realtor	
	bro why stop at one house	
	Industries are going to be REVOLUTIONIZED by blockchain technology, and this is just the beginning. We're coming up on a 4th Industrial Revolution.	
	Only about 1 in every 1,000 people are involved in the crypto space right now. Imagine getting in on Facebook at that stage....
