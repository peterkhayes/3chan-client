a	First off, this community is incredible and I am dying to become part of it!	
	Welcome!	
	hi-roooo

a	I have a few questions on how much it would realistically cost to get myself involved in the van life. I have two ideas on how to play this out:	
a	1/ Purchase an already converted van for cheap and use it for a few months while I built a plan to build the ideal van.	
a	2/ Bunker down and build my first van with no experience, some help, and a lot of planning.	
	exciting~	
	ya, sounds about right	
a	I'm looking for advice on which path to choose! I'm a 24 year old male with some construction and property maintenance experience. I also work remotely so I have a lot of flexibility and time on my hands.\n\nAll in all, I want to get on that VanLife ASAP. Been landlocked in an apartment in a city I dislike for too long so It's time to hit the road. Advice?
	any idea what sort of setup you're looking for, van-wise?	
a	Things I want in my van:\n\n\n- High top (I'm 6'3")\n- Full bed\n- Solar Powered\n- Water Pump/Sink\n- Stove (gas camper is fine)\n- Fridge\n- Fully outfitted, but nothing *too* luxurious.
	> I have a few questions on how much it would realistically cost to get myself involved in the van life.\n\nThe scale is _tremendous_. You could probably do it for a under $5k total including the vehicle if you really wanted to. You can also do it for over $100k, even without getting "too luxurious".
	Yeah, even with your limited list of things, the price range can be huge.\n\nDo you want Lithium batteries? How long do you want to be able to be off grid? How well insulated are you going to make it? what about a heater for the unexpected cold / when you're at elevation?
	The problem with "the ideal van" is that you have no clue what's "ideal" for you, until you've actually lived in one for a while.\n\nYou could take your time, get everything "perfect", then go out on the road and find out "oh, hey i didn't consider x, y, or z" You'll also find out that many of your beliefs about "needs" and even what's "good" or "bad" are completely wrong in many areas.
	does anybody ever wonder why we say "x, y, z" instead of "a, b, c" or "h, i, j" or any of the other letters?\n\n/3/showerthoughts
	Lesson #1: beware of overpurchasing	
	I can relate to the over purchasing. The return guy at my Home Depot knows my name. (You have to show your license if you do not have the receipt on you).	
b	First time poster here! Can't wait to move in permanently to our home on wheels. This is our cosy conversion! What do ya think?

e	Wow everybody, looking for moral support and advice	
	what happened?	
e	So I own a van, but live in a nice apartment.\n\nJust found this note on my van windshield (pasting in, one sec)
	(waiting)	
e	"Attn: Owner of Grey/Silver Sedan and Van\n\nYou have been spotted by many home owners and have been reported to authority. To avoid towing and criminal action please remove yourself and your belongings from this property. Unless you can prove ownership you are trespassing!!! You will be towed if not removed by Nov 18.\n\nThank you,\nConcerned Home Owners"
	lol "concerned" home owners	
	as if	
	wooowww, what snobs	
	So sorry <username_e>! :sad:	
	Well, you are legally doing nothing wrong. It's your neighbors who are being snobby. You just have to go knock on their door and let them know what's going on, even though it sucks you have to do this emotional labor for something that is 100% not your fault.	
	What are people really trying to say about people who live in vans anyway? That you're not a real person if you don't live in a (quote-unquote) "real" house?\n\nThat is so stuck up.
	:sad:	
f	Today a distracted driver ran a red light at 50 mph and hit us without even braking. Please just put down your phone and drive. Yes serious injuries. Yes van totaled Iâ€™m sure.\n\nThis was this morning. Just, hand the phone to the passenger or leave it off.

	Oh my goodness! Are you okay?	
f	I'm doing okay, yeah, but we broke some bones and will be in the hospital for a while. It's going to be really hard for us to miss this much work...and no idea how we can afford to repair the van.\n\nIt was a hit and run :sad: :tear:
	Hey - everybody, this is what 3chan is for. Let's come together and start a GoFundMe to help <username_f> through this difficult time!
