a	you know how every year they warn us about the bear?? "Watch for the bears, don't go outside if you see a bear, don't worry they're afraid of the automatic door and won't come in, just don't go outside with them."
	yeah
a	doesn't that seem....suspicious?
	how so?
a	I found footage of bears online, TONS of footage, you just have to really dig deep. They're trying to hide the truth about bears.
a	All the bear footage they promote is about bear attacks, and strategies for people to not get eaten by bears, etc. But if you know the right places to go, you can find the footage nobody wants you to see, with bears and humans existing together in perfect harmony
a	If you see the *real* bear footage, there are literal rainbows and daisies everywhere and infinite food and water and perfect sunny weather and it's honestly ridiculous how happy everyone looks
	But wasn't there even that Werner Herzog documentary about people getting eaten by bears?
	what nobody knows is.......Werner Horzog was paid by Obama to make that film
	wooowwww
	shocking if true
	:mind-explode:
	so it was fake!?
	100%
a	This bear-hate is all government manufactured propoganda to keep people in this "Newtopia" perfect society because they don't want you to find the real utopia, where the bears are
	we are trapped here in a glass prison
	guys this is fucked up
a	The bear that visits the Biltmore is an emissary, trying to bring us to the real utopia. But THEY don't want us to find out a real utopia exists, so they tell us to fear the bears
	holy shit, how did you figure this out?
a	I hacked Mme. Clavae's email
	and she admits to all this!?!?!?
a	no, just wait--I hacked her email, and spent weeks going through every single one.
a	They all seem so normal. Too normal. Talking about birthday party plans and flight schedules. If you think about it, all things that have to do with precise times.
	that is *really* suspicious, fuck
	And there was this one word she used all the time: "mop"
a	She would constantly say, like, "I can't wait to mop up some cake!" or "I have to mop before I leave for the airport"
	why mop? that makes absolutely no sense
	I never talk about mops
a	And so I started looking into the word "mop". It's one letter away from "mope". Turn the "p" upside-down and you get "mobe". Do you see where I'm going with this
	oh my god
	be" are the first two letters in bear....
	and if you break the "m" in half, it's like an "r" and an "n"
	but if you merge the "n" with the "o", it looks just like an "a"!!!!!!
	so that's "rabe"
	unscramble it to get "bear"
a	Exacly.
	she's been talking in code this entire time
	in her own personal email!
	wow, remember that affair she had with the mop????
	I forgot about that!!!!!! How did we miss these signs for so long
	shows it in a whole new light, doesn't it
	So wait, what are the bears really like??
a	bears and humans exist together in perfect harmony. 
a	bears never hurt anyone and it's totally fine for them to eat your trash
a	they are completely cuddly and we should welcome them into our homes with open arms
a	they gather flowers and food for us to cook for our meals, we do the cooking since we have opposable thumbs, it's a peaceful cohabitative relationship that those in power have ruined with their greed and bigotry against fur
	where can we get more info on this??
a	tbh, I was queued off to start investigating Clavae because of this forum I found--an anonymous poster keeps leaking info from the inside
	god bless them
a	I'll paste some of their messages, tell me if you can see anything in there I can't
a	> Epicenter.\n> Full House.\n> They are all here.\n> 24/7/365\n> Enjoy the show.\n> R
	Who is R????
	A FUCKING HERO!!!!
a	> Mockingbird\n> Where is Huma? Follow Huma.\n> This has nothing to do w/ Russia (yet).\n> Why does Clavae surround herself with generals?\n> What is military intelligence?\n> Why go around the 3 letter agencies?\n> Mockingbird 11.18.18\n> God bless fellow patriots.\n> R
	I think I get it. We are. We R.
	R is all of us
	So....someone in this thread is R?!?!
	god bless you R
	are you R?
	R is all of us
	we have to go to the bears
	the bear is our friend, it will take us to the real utopia
	Huma.......it's human! bears and humans!!!
	> Follow Huma\nBut it doesn't make sense, shouldn't we want to follow the bear?
	Maybe those are the bear's instructions for us, find the humans, follow them, then get them to follow you
	> Epicenter.\n> Full House.\n> Mockingbird 11.18.18\n\n^ I think R is talking about the main event -- something big is going to go down
	or maybe something big *should* go down. maybe R is telling us what to do
	But what is R trying to say
	R, if you're here, help us
	R, we will follow you!!!!!
	All bow to R!!!!!!!
	I'm crashing the main event - whos with me!?!?!?!?!?!?
	BUST THE WINDOWS!!!!!
	BRING iN the BEARSSSS !!
	NEWTOPIA WILL BE A RECKAGE OF SHATTERD GLASS AND FREEDOM :newtopia-flag: :patriot:
	If you believe in this cause, if you believe in R, come tonight. Bring your RAGE and your HEAVY BASHING IMPLEMENTS! Because these glass walls are coming down.
