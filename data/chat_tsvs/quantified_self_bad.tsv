a	as you all know, humans lose a lot of combined life hours attempting to fall asleep	
	i literally stay awake worrying about that, which I realize only exacerbates the issue	
a	SO, I've been trying strategies to fall asleep faster for maximum efficiency	
	truly doing the lord's work :praying-hands:	
a	Last night, I stood on one leg for 5 minutes before getting into bed. Using my fitbit, I determined I fell asleep 12 minutes faster. That's a net gain of 7m per night	
	For how long have you been collecting your sleep data? Just making sure this is a robust sample	
	did somebody say..."bust" :troll-face: :boobs:	
a	I have sleep data going back 3 years. But I agree that I need to do this same experiment for at least a couple weeks to prove it wasn't a fluke	
	I'd love to see this data on a chart	
	I'd love to see YOUR data on a chart, if you know what I mean	
	...I don't, actually?	
	Neat, have you gotten any other insights from your sleep logs?	
a	Well, at first, I was tracking my sleep only. But then I realized the data was too siloed, and I needed more context to draw patterns from the data. So I started keeping an hourly log of anything notable--whether work was stressful, what I'd eaten, etc	
a	I noticed an odd correlation with bean consumption and time to fall asleep. It was, on average, 3m longer when beans had been consumed at dinner time (7:00 pm or later).	
	so you were, like, farting a lot?	
	ok maybe tmi	
	lol any correlating data for date nights and time to fall asleep? :wink: :high-five:	
	real talk, currently trying to optmize my "getting a gf" game	
	same, except looking for a bf	
	ah, dunno if these data sets are cross-comparable, but when trying to establish romantic interest, I've noticed a positive linear relationship with "length of eye contact" as the Y and "romantic interest shown from other party" as the X, with noticable declining effects after "length of eye contact" exceeds 30 straight seconds, after which a negative effect is noted	
	Iiiiinteresting.	
	Wait sry let me translate this nerd math speak into real human english - you're saying that you finally found out as a 40 y/o neck breather that women like it when you make flirty eye contact with them!?!?	
	roflroflroflrofl (literally can't stop laughing rn)	
	Wonder what it is about the 30 second mark that's so substantial?	
	If any of ya'll want to meet up in person, we can try staring into each others' eyes and trying to quantify this subjectively?	
	Subjective analysis is suboptimal, but yeah, sometimes it's all you have	
	why don't you guys just say you want to fuck each other in the ass and get this over with	
	lol this is like a bad porn novel or s/th	
	if ya'll want REAL dating advice, head over to my sub /3/PUA	
	"I'm also part of a great support network for people who have a hard time finding romantic and sexual connection, would really recommend any/all interested parties join me there.\n\nIt's called /3/incel"	
	Data question--Is there a way to get data emailed to a Gmail address, and be parsed and integrated into a Google Sheet? I want to be able to run a Siri shortcut on my phone so I can have HealthKit data sent to a Google Sheet, where it can be calculated and presented in a solid format in Google Data Studio.	
	:drools:	
	Why can't I find a woman who will talk optimization workflows to me like that	
	SO! Who here is interested in doing a /3/QuantifiedSelf cencus!? We all love data, seems like a great chance to get some data on our community	
	in	
	also in	
	definitely	
	I'll make a prediction - for "gender" we're 98% male	
	the group only has 77 members; 98% male is impossible, unless somehow a fraction of a human is female?	
	I thought the leftist mantra was that "gender is a spectrum" anyway	
	Why are there so few girls here?	
	"I'm sure there are several reasons, the most obvious one being: Quantified Self is exactly what it says on the tin, quantified/mathy.\n\nAnd women are just naturally less drawn to maths and sciences."	
	Wait, really? I don't know about that	
	I think that's true. I was a math major and there was maybe one woman in my cohort? Certainly no more than three.	
	This is an awful lot of speculation for someone who hasn't even taken a census yet?	
	Hi girls in this chat, please identify yourselves

	Wow. You really went there.	
	:dying-laughing:	
	Um, speaking of why there are no women here, this toxic environemnt is probably why?	
	"environment" -> ftfy	
	Or it's because women suck for not dating us ?	
mod	"10 new users have voted!\n\nPOLL: ARE WOMEN PEOPLE?\n\nYES [-]\nNO   [-------------]"	
	um	
mod	"8 new users have voted!\n\nPOLL: ARE WOMEN PEOPLE?\n\nYES [--]\nNO   [-------------------]"	
	Well well well, looks like all has been decided	
	This is seriously fucked up. I'm out.	
mod	/* user ^ has left the chat */	
	^ Guys, I think we found out who the 0.2 woman was	
	Heh	
	So I was lurking /3/keto the other day, and I heard them talking about jicama enemas putting people into ketosis faster. Anybody here experimented with this?	
	Huh, interesting. Is anybody else here keto?	
	Honestly, I measure my cognition daily (exactly at 7:30 am and before coffee as a standard) via math questions, and I noticed that my cognition takes a slight hit on carb-restricted diets. But YMMV, I know it works well for a lot of people	
	Just remember - it's not always the diet's fault when it comes to cognition benchmarks. I know this is a touchy subject, but you can't blame your IQ on diet, it just varies across the population	
	Just remember - just because you tell someone "you're an idiot" in elegant words doesn't make you less of an asshole?	
	I actually noticed a slight bump from keto, yeah. However, worth noting that I always did my benchmarks after a bulletproof coffee. I do my non-keto benchmarks with regular coffee, but it's possible that the MCTs have a direct and short-term effect on working memory capacity	
c	My thing with keto is, cognition boost or not, there is a big time cost incurred from eating under any dietary restriction, and while there is some research about its impacts on longevity, I'm not convinced that 1 year at 70 years old is as valuable as 1 year at 30 years old. So I've chosen to optimize for time while young instead of time while old	
	So you'd rather optimize for the years you're young and alone vs young and alone, is what you're saying	
	hey, when you're young and alone, at least you can masturbate	
	so tl;dr, you eat whatever you want now because it's way easier and buys you more free hours while young, vs spending time on a dietary restriction that might help you live longer but those later years will be relatively less valuable?	
c	pretty much	
	Yeah, I see that. That's legit.	
	Unfortunately, my lizard brain won't let me make such rational calculations. I MUST LIVE FOREVER.

	That chat doesn't even exist? I got a 404	
	...you actually clicked the link?	
	um	
	Does anybody know how I can I log my YouTube viewing history into an RSS feed or Google Calendar?	
	Before you do that--and seriously, I speak from personal experience--scrub your porn history. Let's just say my calendar was shared with my parents, which I'd completely forgotten about.	
	"Wait what, was your calendar shared with your parents because you...live with them still?\n\nYou know what, actually just don't answer that. I don't want to see my future."	
	You watch porn on YouTube? Dude go to PornHub like everybody else, YouTube doesn't even have good porn	
	"Does anyone have a remote body temp scanner?\n\nI was thinking of a tracker which can sit by my office that scans to maybe where my face would be in the chair, and if I my body is getting cold or hot, then adjust the aircon?"	
	hm.....	
	First your brain would have to be working to make your body run hot

d	Quick mini-thread on Social Life Tracking!	
d	I created a proof of concept app earlier for myself to track my interactions with people, notes and anecdotes about those people, with dates I should follow up with them to continue networking. 	
d	I'm motivated to build this for more of a mass market. Would anyone be interested in that? And are there any tools you are already using to track personal interactions/networking?	
e	No offense, but this sounds kind of like a serial killer app to me. That said, I'd still use it.	
d	Did you ever track details about the interaction or the person? From my perspective, following up (or "staying in touch") is important but so are notes ("talking points") about each person. Is that valuable to you?	
e	Probably not, not for my networking anyway as I can see talking notes etc based on a LinkedIn conversation history. Though it would be highly valuable with dating / pick-up.	
	Riiiight, "networking"	
	Can you give some examples about what kind of data you were tracking? :)	
d	Sure:	http://i.imgur.com/g7IbIcO.jpg

f	Weird question--(Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask a strange personal question...)	
f	tl;dr it seems like I have a 10 day hormonal cycle, yet I am a man who doesn't menstruate?	
	So what you're saying is: You're a woman!!?	
	Guys, we found her!	
f	Longer story: I've been tracking some subjective measurements which might have psychological or hormonal influences. I record a data point daily. I've noticed, over the past two months, that I seem to have a cycle with a period of about 10 days.	
	What percentile distribution would you say your boobs are in? 2 standard deviations from the mean? I'd take 1 tbh, just curious	
f	I do not have a menstrual cycle (as far as I know). Is there any known biological mechanism that could be at work here?	
	Huh. Could there be some event that happens to you in a regular cycle? Like..I dunno, a shedding of your uterine lining?
