ex-mahayana	Let's assume the premise that I'm a sadist with strong morals. I only pair up with masochists who fully consent to the activities in which we are involved in. Do any of the activities, no matter how "bad" they may seem go against Buddhism? I genuinely want to know more. I appreciate your response. Thank you.	
	I'd ask, what is the center of my life? Does this activity support liberation or suffering? Does it help me save all beings?	
	If you see a genuine conflict, and you're worried about whether or not you can continue the lifestyle while being a buddhist, it seems like you value the BDSM more highly than Buddhism. Isn't that the more important issue?	
	Yeah why are you worried about whether or not you can keep an attachment to BDSM?	
	It's not enjoyment that is discouraged, rather it is clinging / attachment that leads to suffering when the pleasurable activity ends.	
EarwormsRU	The issue is not one of whether something's "bad" or not, or "prohibited" by Buddhism. What Buddha taught is that there are consequences of every action (including thought). He also advised to chew on his advices, decide for yourself whether what he had to say has value. So..	
	Buddha taught that if you die with unsatisfied desire for existence or sensual pleasure, then you'll be reborn. And of course you'll be taking your karma and desires "with you" into your next life. Your actions will probably have consequences in this life, too. How do you think that "energy" of wishing to inflict pain on someone, or to control someone, might manifest?	
	"And, do you believe the ""energy"" of a physically-violent act always quickly dissipates without consequence, for example if the recipient appears to be awake (which I doubt is the case anyway) and consenting? (FWIW I don't.)\n\nWith metta."	
	"At least as far as Theravada Buddhism (the oldest surviving form of Buddhism ) goes, there isn't much written about what defines defines sexual misconduct:\n\nno sex with people in committed relationships\nno sex with nuns or monks, or people who have vowed to put sex/relationships aside\nno sex with minors\nno sex with adults who can't consent ( mental disability, etc )\nHaving said that The Four Noble truths are what Buddhist teachings are. The basic message is that to end misery or even discount in your life you have to learn how to stop clinging to things in your life.\n\nI don't know you, but my impression of BDSM is that it is all about have a fetish, which is the epitome of clinging. If you interest interest in BDSM isn't a fetish, but really a part of your sexuality you will have to do your own thinking about how to square that with Buddhist teachings."	
	Tantric Buddhism, which originated around the 11th and 12th centuries in India, rooted its foundation in the concept of female reverence and the important role female power and knowledge played in the overall attainment of enlightenment.	
	"Is misleading. It is likely that Theravada resembles the older forms of Buddhism, but Theravada is not itself ""the oldest surviving form of Buddhism"" because there is no oldest surviving form.\n\nUnless you adopt Therevada's view of itself, which is contradicted by history."	
	"I don't think you understand how fetishes work. Fetishes are not equivalent to clinging. Fetishes are just ""that which turns you on"" for people who happen to get turned on by things other than what's considered normal. If you are a man and you get highly aroused by beautiful naked women, is that also a form of clinging? No, it's just a lustful state of mind, and if whatever sex transpires is fully consensual (and not cheating, I presume) then it's not even breaking a precept.\n\nSex can (and should) be a very wholesome activity. This is true regardless of whether or not the sex involves a fetish. In some cases it's true especially if you have a fetish, since it validates a part of you that normally is stigmatized by society. To have a partner who thinks it's cool that you get turned on by shoes, or whatever, means suddenly you aren't walking around with a cloud of shame hanging over your head, a lurking voice that says ""no one will ever love you because of this, you freak"". To be liberated from that shame is powerful medicine and could definitely be beneficial to practice."	
	"I don't think you understand how fetishes work.\n\nMaybe not. I'm not a psychological professional. Are you?\n\nMy understanding is that people are not born with fetishes.\n\nThey acquire them from contact with an object/situation and certain feelings being associated with those things. Those experiences are supposed to become fetishes after a person repeatedly seeks out those same feelings in the same objects/situations.\n\nI could be wrong, but that sounds exactly like what dependent origination and the 4 Noble Truths tell people to avoid."	
	"No, but I've spoken with one about my own fetishes and I've read a fair amount on the subject.\n\nThere are a lot of theories about it but nobody really knows why or how fetishes come to be. Then again, nobody really knows why or how the typical male attraction to breasts comes to be either. We can explain why it might be evolutionary advantageous to have such an attraction, but we don't understand how the attraction comes to be. Just like how we don't understand how Joe Schmoe came to fetishize shoes.\n\nUnless the fetish is innately harmful (e.g., you get off on killing people), there's no reason whatsoever to treat it as being outside the scope of normal healthy human sexual behavior."	
	The precept for lay people is against "sexual misconduct". As I understand it this include rape, underage, adultery, and incest. I think as long as you are SSC, you're safe.	
	I'm Buddhist and have been heavily into the BDSM scene for a couple decades. It in no way contradicts the teachings so long as you follow that Golden Rule of Consent (as mentioned). I also make it a point to share knowledge freely in what can be a guarded culture... Pay it forward as it were. Last, I try to always realize I will always have opportunities to learn from anyone, no matter what their experience level might be.	
	the true power exchange dynamic existing in BDSM (bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, sadism/masochism) parallels many of the Tantric Buddhism notions involving respect, communication, trust, and vulnerability in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment, bliss, and ecstasy.	
	Tantric Buddhism gained immense cultural popularity during the Pala period of India. This sect of Buddhism was not limited to any particular caste system, nor was it isolated to a specific gender.	
	Tantric Buddhism sets itself apart from other spiritual practices of the time in its focus on the reverence of women and the understanding that spiritual enlightenment is to be achieved by embracing the feminine for guidance and worship. Tantric Buddhism holds reverence for the divine feminine creative powers (Shaw 32). The belief is that it essentially was senseless to exclude the female representation of the Buddha since bodies are both male and female and Buddhahood is attainable in the present life and in the present body	
	The body is a vehicle for attaining a blissful state for the mind. Tantric Buddhism is unique in its acceptance of the body and the senses as sources of knowledge and power (Shaw 140) rather than reasons behind suffering and shame.	
	Tantric texts articulate a profound and appreciative metaphysical understanding of female embodimen	
	The female figures are independent and proud yet when they are enjoined with masculinity they achieve the roles of teachers, spiritual allies, and mystical companions. Their male partners, rather than being portrayed as dominators or suppressors, are lovers, supplicants, and spiritual companions	
	Tantric Buddhism rests in the foundational knowledge that women are essential to achieving spiritual enlightenment. Tantric women gurus have the ability to achieve enlightenment on their own. They are strong, independent, aware of their power and revel in their power. They are “proud of their strength, delight in shrewdish behavior, and derive pleasure from the fact they are untamable”	
	The goal of achieving bliss and the importance of honoring the feminine as a balance between energies are strong parallels in the philosophies of BDSM. “Both Tantra and BDSM are erotic arts of consciousness.”	
	Both employ sex techniques, focus on stimulating the senses, are consensual between practitioners, raise erotic energy and “encourage personal freedom, individuality and imagination”	
	Sensory experiences are not a source of suffering, but rather a source of bliss	
	Define bliss	
	a metaphysical experience	
	soulful happiness	
	the feeling of connecting with the sacred and the divine	
	Tantra emphasizes predominately reverence to the woman, which can be expressed in various ways beyond the ritual: cooking for her, serving her, or massaging her feet. BDSM coins this relationship as a Domme/submissive paralleling the female Guru/male disciple dynamic. 	
	Tantric Buddhism offers the illusion that women are in the dominant position.	
	It is as though men needed to be pushed farther away from the extreme of their egocentricity in order to embrace the role and meaning of women in the dynamic in order to achieve balance.	
	The main elements in sexual connection with the goal of ecstasy are to transcend time, become egoless, and to be in your natural state (Carrellas 18). Passion and pleasure are important, but not ignorance and lust. Detachment from the ego is critical, and intimacy exists (Shaw 168-169).
