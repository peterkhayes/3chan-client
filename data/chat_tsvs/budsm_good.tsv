a	Let's assume the premise that I'm a sadist with strong morals.	
a	I only pair up with masochists who fully consent to the activities in which we are involved in.	
a	Do any of the activities, no matter how "bad" they may seem go against Buddhism? I genuinely want to know more. I appreciate your response. Thank you.	
b	I'd ask, what is the center of my life? Does this activity support liberation or suffering?	
c	Does it help me save all beings?	
d	If you see a genuine conflict, and you're worried about whether or not you can continue the lifestyle while being a buddhist, it seems like you value the BDSM more highly than Buddhism. Isn't that the more important issue?	
e	Yeah why are you worried about whether or not you can keep an attachment to BDSM?	
f	The issue is not one of whether something's "bad" or not, or "prohibited" by Buddhism. What Buddha taught is that there are consequences of every action	
f	Including thought	
g	How do you think that "energy" of wishing to inflict pain on someone, or to control someone, might manifest?	
g	Many people find fantasies and sex play involving things-that-would-be-horrific-in-the-real-world to be enjoyable. I can't explain why... maybe our brains are just wired that way.	
h	The third precept says not to engage in sexual misconduct, but does not define "misconduct".	
i	At least as far as Theravada Buddhism (the oldest surviving form of Buddhism, mind you) goes, we have:	
i	no sex with people in committed relationships no sex with nuns or monks,	
i	or people who have vowed to put sex/relationships aside	
i	no sex with minors	
i	no sex with adults who can't consent ( mental disability, etc )	
i	Having said that The Four Noble truths are what Buddhist teachings are. The basic message is that to end misery or even discount in your life you have to learn how to stop clinging to things in your life.	
b	I don't know you, but my impression of BDSM is that it is all about have a fetish, which is the epitome of clinging.	
b	If your interest interest in BDSM isn't a fetish, but really a part of your sexuality you will have to do your own thinking about how to square that with Buddhist teachings.	
h	Yeah it's not enjoyment that is discouraged, rather it is clinging / attachment that leads to suffering when the pleasurable activity ends.	
j	Buddha taught that if you die with unsatisfied desire for existence or sensual pleasure, then you'll be reborn. And of course you'll be taking your karma and desires "with you" into your next life. 	
j	Your actions will probably have consequences in this life, too.	http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/c0/c09781c93040d47753e5f4a8bd1355dd3a1e417b1ebf9e267e2a59a241a04c28.jpg
a	I don't think you understand how fetishes work.	
a	Fetishes are not equivalent to clinging.	
a	Fetishes are just "that which turns you on" for people who happen to get turned on by things other than what's considered normal.	
a	If you are a man and you get highly aroused by beautiful naked women, is that also a form of clinging?	
a	No, it's just a lustful state of mind, and if whatever sex transpires is fully consensual (and not cheating, I presume) then it's not even breaking a precept.	
j	I don't think _you_ understand how fetishes work.	
a	Maybe not. I'm not a psychological professional. Are you?	
j	Well my understanding is that people are not born with fetishes.	
j	They acquire them from contact with an object/situation and certain feelings being associated with those things.	
j	Those experiences are supposed to become fetishes after a person repeatedly seeks out those same feelings in the same objects/situations.	
j	I could be wrong, but that sounds exactly like what dependent origination and the 4 Noble Truths tell people to avoid.	
a	Well I've spoken with one about my own fetishes and I've read a fair amount on the subject.	
a	There are a lot of theories about it but nobody really knows why or how fetishes come to be.	
a	Then again, nobody really knows why or how the typical male attraction to breasts comes to be either. We can explain why it might be evolutionary advantageous to have such an attraction, but we don't understand how the attraction comes to be. Just like how we don't understand how Joe Schmoe came to fetishize shoes.	
a	Unless the fetish is innately harmful (e.g., you get off on killing people), there's no reason whatsoever to treat it as being outside the scope of normal healthy human sexual behavior.	
k	Can we keep 3chan buddhism free from troll posts? This is not even remotely funny.	
a	I can understand why you would think that, but my interest in Buddhism does overlap my interest with BDSM.	
a	I am not 100% devoted to either activity, but I still wanted to know if they would conflict.	
a	I honestly appreciate the answers I've gotten, especially the first.	
l	I would say that giving in to our fantisies for sexual gratification (or any gratification for that matter) is the opposite of what the Buddha taught.	
l	I am a monk...	
k	I'm leaving	
i	The precept for lay people is against "sexual misconduct". As I understand it this include rape, underage, adultery, and incest. I think as long as you are SSC, you're safe.	
l	SSC?	
i	Safe, Sane, and Consensual	
m	I'm Buddhist and have been heavily into the BDSM scene for a couple decades.	
m	It in no way contradicts the teachings so long as you follow that Golden Rule of Consent (as mentioned).	
m	I also make it a point to share knowledge freely in what can be a guarded culture... Pay it forward as it were.	
m	Last, I try to always realize I will always have opportunities to learn from anyone, no matter what their experience level might be.	
n	Sexual fantasies in the mind is already based on Greed.	
n	Sexual fantasies thats relating submissions, domination, odd penetrations, torture etc etc means you have Greed for cruelty.	
n	Of course it's not as bad as if your Ted Bundy or Buffalo Bill who actually take it one step further.	
n	But yeah, all this unwholesomeness starts some where.	
j	Normalising this sort of behaviour is not open mindedness, it's harming other people by deluding them.	
j	Inhibition is not a bad thing.	
l	If you were one of the Buddha's disciples, would you ask him if BSDM was okay?	
j	I think that would be one of the rare times the Awakened One's face would show discontent.	
j	You wouldn't achieve Nirvana with those actions... you would reborn somewhere unpleasant!!	
i	If you judge for your self what you are doing is not misconduct, then it is not.	
j	If any sexual act is a source of suffering then it is sexual misconduct.	
j	If it leads to attachment and/or aversion then it is sexual misconduct. 	
j	ANY SEXUAL ACT (or any "class" of sexual activity).	
j	If it gives rise to one of the eight worldly dharmas (hope of happiness, praise, gain and fame, and/or fear of suffering, disgrace, blame and loss) then it is sexual misconduct.	
l	Now since we live in samsara almost any activity, perpetrated within a deluded and ignorant mindset, will lead to suffering.	
l	Even the most "wholesome" of activities.
