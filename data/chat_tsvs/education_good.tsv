	So i've beeen thinking a lot about education recently. 
	Yeah, I just had a baby last year... really don't want this kid going through our current system.
	It's crazy rite? Like, the whole thing is just this factory for making these little robots, you know? I feel like now with everything all new we have a chance to build something different.
	I really hated my educational experience as a kid. That's why I sent all mine to Montessori. Seriously, worth every penny.
	Oh yeah? I hear that like kids don't learn anything there. My friend's kid didn't even learn to read until she was 8 or something. I just think that's crazy
	Ok but I mean, do we have any scientific proof that reading is really necessary? It's all about expanding the mind. And *one* way you can do that is by learning to read, but that's not the only way. I prefer meditation tbh
	Check what happened to my kid--we're keto, right? Well his public school refuses to acknowledge his eating prefs and made him eat mashed potatoes. :eyeroll:
	Well that's the thing...you just dont know what your getting until the kids get there....so messed up. what happened to standards in educatoin
	Ok but like aren't standards just this arbitrary thing that we use to justify whatever we want? Like you know, the SAT, it's only the kids with rich parents that do well because they go to those classes that let them game the system. Standards keep people down
	A fucking men
	I got a 1580 on my SATs guys
	Yo, shut the fuck up

	omg thank you. I love this chat already.
a	Well, here's really what I want to be thinking about. In Newtopia, our central goal should be to strive for equality. And we can't have equality in a situation where some people have access to resources others don't. Montessori, for example, is a great idea and clearly a better way to educate our children, but it costs money. Who's going to foot the bill for that? We can say that we want a centralized authority to pay for it, which, great. I'm in favor. But also, those resources have to come from somewhere, and eventually we're going to have to make choices. (...)
	I'm with you there.
	+1
	Sir (or madam!) I tip my fedora to you
	^ :clap: for inclusion
a	(...) I think that instituting some sort of Montessori system that evades some of the problems pointed out by other users here, and which I've seen myself too--that sometimes it's an excuse not to teach kids anything at all, or focuses too much on creative pursuits and doesn't teach kids enough math, for example. I'd actually like to propose something more like this. Have you all heard of unschooling? It's like Montessori meets homeschooling. That way, parents get to decide how their kids are taught. First problem: not all parents will want or be able to do this. Fair point. (...)
	Iiiiinteresting.
a	(...) So I suggest a sort of distributed education system, wherein parents who do not want to teach send their kids to other parents who do, and there is effectively a distributed educational system wherein each "school" has its own niche. Your kid is leaning more towards math? Send them to the school with the physicist. Your kid is leaning more towards the arts? Send them to the school with the painter. Know what I mean?
	Hm, I like that. It's like the libertarian ephemerisle reconfigurable cities thing but for schools.
	Wooowwww, when we brainstorm it all out like this, it really makes you wonder--why aren't more people doing stuff like this?! It's just so obviously superior to everything else that has ever been done in education
b	god in my book anything that isn't standard public school is a ridiculous improvement. it's hard to get any worse, i think i'm still scarred from high school
b	(sorry for the religious reference lol)
	yeah, I was really bullied in hs :( someone stole my underwear once, every day, until I didn't have any underwear left. at all. I was so embarrassed to ask my dad for more so I went commando the rest of the year
	Guys, guys. What if there wasn't a teacher, and assignments and lectures were communicated over the blockchain? No one could cheat on their homework because everything is graded in a distributed fashion.
	Even better: go full tech. Every kid gets a VR headset in their home, and virtually attends school. VR is so much better. Imagine if you weren't just looking at a book, but you were fully-immersed, IN A RAINFOREST. 
	I like the way you think. I'd be happy to fund this sort of thing as soon as my blockchain startup takes off.
	So, I've read a lot of research about non-traditional education, and overall it's really hard to evaluate its efficacy. While there are a lot of examples of non-traditionally-educated kids going to do great things, these kids also often have rich parents, with lots of time and money to dedicate to their education. That makes it hard to know whether it was the schooling that helped, or if the kids would have thrived in the same public school environments.
	Now, in a utopia like we're all building, everyone's on the same footing. So maybe this will be a great opportunity to do exactly the kind of research that education researchers have been dreaming of for decades?
	Has anybody used clustering algorithms to group classes? You could cluster students according to scores in subjects e.g. every month so that the curriculum could be dynamically adjusted to accommodate the maximum number reasonably possible.
	Yes, but switching students every month will amount to a problem of “thrashing”, where every month teachers are spending time re-learning their classroom, instead of serving it.
	And, well, I'll just say it. Here's the thing about teachers. I'll put it this way: in the average GRE scores by intended field, education ranks below philosophy & STEM in every subtest, and various forms of education rank very low (early childhood education is, out of 50 groups, second from the bottom in 2 subtests and fifth from the bottom in the last subtest).
	Anyone who claims that teachers are stupid is using propaganda instead of ETS data.
	> Anyone who claims that teachers are stupid is using propaganda instead of ETS data.\n\nWould you accept "mediocre"? ;-)
	There are a number of research groups tracking teachers and student test scores. If such results had been released anywhere, wouldn't they be front page national news? And this seems like something that, e.g. the Gates Foundation would want known: if true, it's a magic bullet.\n\nWhy haven't academics and foundations studying teacher quality and value-added metrics reported such results?
	Okay, I respect your ability to have this discussion, but I'm not sure it's appropriate for this thread? I'd really rather get back to discussing top level ideas. Tearing teachers down isn't helping anyone right now.
	This ^
	THISSS ^^^^^^
	I'm kind of digging the distributed model mentioned above tbh
	Ok but like, what if we don't have enough people who are willing to teach? Are we taking volunteers?
	I'd do it.
	Same! This sounds fun.
	I'm in! I'm no math genius, but I got the art part down.
	How many teachers do you think we'll need?
	Guess it depends on the population of Newtopia?
	Yeah, I mean, how many of us even want to have kids? I don't want any of my own.
	I've got a newborn, but he won't need school for another 4-5 years I guess.
	Mme Clavae's is in the same boat.
	Who else has kids?
	I've got a 7 y/o and a 3 y/o
	OMG I'm never having kids. I can barely do my own laundry lol
	rite, same
	Yeah, I'm in the no-kids boat, but I'm ok if others have them, just not for me. ykinmkbtok (your kid is not my kid but that's okay)
	(I'll see myself out now)
	ba-dum tsh
	lol
	Well, ha, it currently looks like we have one teacher per student. Problem solved guys!
	YUSSS
