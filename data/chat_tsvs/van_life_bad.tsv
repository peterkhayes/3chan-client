a	First off, this community is incredible and I am dying to become part of it!	
	Welcome!	
	hi-roooo	
	but are you litereally dying tho (plz say yes)	
	ok...rude?	
a	I have a few questions on how much it would realistically cost to get myself involved in the van life! I have two ideas on how to play this out:	
a	1/ Purchase an already converted van for cheap and use it for a few months while I built a plan to build the ideal van.	
a	2/ Bunker down and build my first van with no experience, some help, and a lot of planning.	
	exciting~	
	ya, sounds about right	
a	"I'm looking for advice on which path to choose! I'm a 24 year old male with some construction and property maintenance experience. I also work remotely so I have a lot of flexibility and time on my hands.\n\nAll in all, I want to get on that VanLife ASAP. Been landlocked in an apartment in a city I dislike for too long so It's time to hit the road. Advice?"	
	"so what you're saying is--you're a rich tech bro who wants to use his six figure savings (despite being a mere 24 years old) to live a ""cheap"" bohemian life because he can afford it?\n\nBecause just saying, that's fucked up & also ur a fucking poser."	
	^ Your knights, they are white. So, so white. :glimmer-eyes: :white-van:	
	any idea what sort of setup you're looking for, van-wise?	
a	"Things I want in my van:\n\n- High top (I'm 6'3"")\n- Full bed\n- Solar Powered\n- Water Pump/Sink\n- Stove (gas camper is fine)\n- Fridge\n- Fully outfitted, but nothing *too* luxurious."	
	"> I'm 6'3""\n\nBut are you single? :wink:"	
mod	"/* MODERATOR MESSAGE */\n\nhello ,, i make adult films and you are beautiful . if you would like to participat in my next filming please let me knwo!! ! i pay fair rates"	
	^ wtf, did the mods get hacked?	
	:raised-eyebrow:	
	lol did we also inherit a fortune from a Nigerian prince ?	
	Maybe they're just pranking us?	
	"> I have a few questions on how much it would realistically cost to get myself involved in the van life.\n\nThe scale is _tremendous_. You could probably do it for a under $5k total including the vehicle if you really wanted to. You can also do it for over $100k, even without getting ""too luxurious""."	
	"> You can also do it for over $100k, even without getting too luxurious\n\ndude in what fucking reality is a hundred fucking k not luxurious!?"	
e	"> a hundred fucking k\n\nwoah that's a lot of K, man...don't think I've ever done 100 oz at once. Is that like enough to get you into the K-hole ? interested in buying if ur selling.."	
	...I think he mean "a hundred k" as in $100,000	
e	oh...sorry	
	lol :woozy: :drunk-face:	
	"> :drunk-face:\n\nI think this dude's on more than alcohol, bro /3/trees /3/druglegalization"	
	:thumbs-up-skintone-420:	
	Van Life or not, these things just cost money. Solar panels cost money, period.	
	Then make your own fucking solar panels?	
	That's....not even reasonable	
	"> The scale is _tremendous_. You could probably do it for a under $5k total including the vehicle if you really wanted to. You can also do it for over $100k, even without getting ""too luxurious"".\n\nYeah, even with your limited list of things, the price range can be huge.\n\nDo you want Lithium batteries? How long do you want to be able to be off grid? How well insulated are you going to make it? what about a heater for the unexpected cold / when you're at elevation?"	
	"The problem with ""the ideal van"" is that you have no clue what's ""ideal"" for you, until you've actually lived in one for a while.\n\nYou could take your time, get everything ""perfect"", then go out on the road and find out ""oh, hey i didn't consider x, y, or z"" You'll also find out that many of your beliefs about ""needs"" and even what's ""good"" or ""bad"" are completely wrong in many areas."	
	"does anybody ever wonder why we say ""x, y, z"" instead of ""a, b, c"" or ""h, i, j"" or any of the other letters?\n\n/3/showerthoughts"	
	Lesson #1: beware of overpurchasing	
	I can relate to the over purchasing. The return guy at my Home Depot knows my name. (You have to show your license if you do not have the receipt on you).	
b	First time poster here! Can't wait to move in permanently to our home on wheels. This is our cosy conversion! What do ya think?

	"is that why I feel seasick?\n\noh wait or is that just the generic ""I'm in a Pottery Barn"" feel :troll-face:"

	^ it's so sad women need this :sad:	
	ugh, humanity sucks	
	Hey - #notallmen	
	Look, as women we don't need your #notallmen bullshit - your job in these conversations is to shut up and listen. We know not all men. But some men, and too many men.	
	Well stop calling out men as though every single man on earth is a bad person	
	That's literally not even what I'm saying	
	wuh-woh, wis the wittle man having a fwagile male ego??
