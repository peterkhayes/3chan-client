a	as you all know, humans lose a lot of combined life hours attempting to fall asleep	
	i literally stay awake worrying about that, which I realize only exacerbates the issue	
a	SO, I've been trying strategies to fall asleep faster for maximum efficiency	
	truly doing the lord's work :praying-hands:	
a	Last night, I stood on one leg for 5 minutes before getting into bed. Using my fitbit, I determined I fell asleep 12 minutes faster. That's a net gain of 7m per night	
	For how long have you been collecting your sleep data? Just making sure this is a robust sample	
a	I have sleep data going back 3 years. But I agree that I need to do this same experiment for at least a couple weeks to prove it wasn't a fluke	
	I'd love to see this data on a chart	
	yeah, have you gotten any other insights from your sleep logs?	
a	Well, at first, I was tracking my sleep only. But then I realized the data was too siloed, and I needed more context to draw patterns from the data. So I started keeping an hourly log of anything notable--whether work was stressful, what I'd eaten, etc	
a	I noticed an odd correlation with bean consumption and time to fall asleep. It was, on average, 3m longer when beans had been consumed at dinner time (7:00 pm or later).	
	lol any correlating data for date nights and time to fall asleep? :wink: :high-five:	
	real talk, currently trying to optmize my "getting a gf" game	
	same, except looking for a bf	
	ah, dunno if these data sets are cross-comparable, but when trying to establish romantic interest, I've noticed a positive linear relationship with "length of eye contact" as the Y and "romantic interest shown from other party" as the X, with noticable declining effects after "length of eye contact" exceeds 30 straight seconds, after which a negative effect is noted	
	Iiiiinteresting.	
	Wonder what it is about the 30 second mark that's so substantial?	
	If any of ya'll want to meet up in person, we can try staring into each others' eyes and trying to quantify this subjectively?	
	Subjective analysis is suboptimal, but yeah, sometimes it's all you have	
	Hey are there any apps for regularly measuring inteligence, psychology, and/or trivia?	
	"Intelligence is considered to be a stable construct, so I don't know if there would be any benefit to measuring it regularly.\n\nFor other aspects of cognition, try neurotrack or braincheck:\n\n* https://www.neurotrack.com/\n* https://braincheck.com/"	
	Data question--Is there a way to get data emailed to a Gmail address, and be parsed and integrated into a Google Sheet? I want to be able to run a Siri shortcut on my phone so I can have HealthKit data sent to a Google Sheet, where it can be calculated and presented in a solid format in Google Data Studio.	
	:drools:	
	Try IFTTT?	
	or Zapier	
	Found this tutorial on triggering IFTTT with Siri: https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-to-trigger-ifttt-applets-with-ios-12s-new-shortcuts-app-and-siri/	
	sick workflow	
	So I was lurking /3/keto the other day, and I heard them talking about jicama enemas putting people into ketosis faster. Anybody here experimented with this?	
	Huh, interesting. Is anybody else here keto?	
	Honestly, I measure my cognition daily (exactly at 7:30 am and before coffee as a standard) via math questions, and I noticed that my cognition takes a slight hit on carb-restricted diets. But YMMV, I know it works well for a lot of people	
	I actually noticed a slight bump from keto, yeah. However, worth noting that I always did my benchmarks after a bulletproof coffee. I do my non-keto benchmarks with regular coffee, but it's possible that the MCTs have a direct and short-term effect on working memory capacity	
b	My thing with keto is, cognition boost or not, there is a big time cost incurred from eating under any dietary restriction, and while there is some research about its impacts on longevity, I'm not convinced that 1 year at 70 years old is as valuable as 1 year at 30 years old. So I've chosen to optimize for time while young instead of time while old	
	so tl;dr, you eat whatever you want now because it's way easier and buys you more free hours while young, vs spending time on a dietary restriction that might help you live longer but those later years will be relatively less valuable?	
b	pretty much	
	Yeah, I see that. That's legit.	
	Unfortunately, my lizard brain won't let me make such rational calculations. I MUST LIVE FOREVER.

	^ Ok but can I come back as an Apple please :sweat-smile:	
	Does anybody know how I can I log my YouTube viewing history into an RSS feed or Google Calendar?	
	Yet again, I think our friend IFTTT can save the day here	
	seriously, how could anybody do QS before IFTTT	
	"Does anyone have a remote body temp scanner?\n\nI was thinking of a tracker which can sit by my office that scans to maybe where my face would be in the chair, and if I my body is getting cold or hot, then adjust the aircon?"	
	hm.....

c	Quick mini-thread on Social Life Tracking!	
c	I created a proof of concept app earlier for myself to track my interactions with people, notes and anecdotes about those people, with dates I should follow up with them to continue networking. 	
c	I'm motivated to build this for more of a mass market. Would anyone be interested in that? And are there any tools you are already using to track personal interactions/networking?	
d	"Personally, I’ve tracked my networking efforts in Excel when seeking internship exposure. I used conditional formatting which prompted me to follow up with people given time elapsed since last contact.\n\nI’d be interested in an intuitive tool though."	
c	Did you ever track details about the interaction or the person? From my perspective, following up (or "staying in touch") is important but so are notes ("talking points") about each person. Is that valuable to you?	
d	Probably not, not for my networking anyway as I can see talking notes etc based on a LinkedIn conversation history. Though it would be highly valuable with dating / pick-up.	
	I’d be very interested in something like this.	
	Can you give some examples about what kind of data you were tracking? :)	
c	Sure:	http://i.imgur.com/g7IbIcO.jpg
	Cool! Do you log anything about people you see every day (wife/girlfriend/kids/parents)?	
e	Weird question--(Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask a strange personal question...)	
e	tl;dr it seems like I have a 10 day hormonal cycle, yet I am a man who doesn't menstruate?	
e	Longer story: I've been tracking some subjective measurements which might have psychological or hormonal influences. I record a data point daily. I've noticed, over the past two months, that I seem to have a cycle with a period of about 10 days.	
e	I do not have a menstrual cycle (as far as I know). Is there any known biological mechanism that could be at work here?	
	Huh. Could there be some event that happens to you three times a month?

g	"Has anybody else here started to realize that they compulsively measure their own pulse?\n\nAt first it was like - just do it for the bio data. And now, I realize I'm doing it all the time as an under-the-table habit, and I'm kind of unhealthily obsessed with my own pulse"	
	How many times a day are you taking it?	
g	That's the thing, I don't even know. That many times.	
	If you don't know, that means you're not even collecting the data anymore. Potentially problematic addictive behavior?
