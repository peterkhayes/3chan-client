mod	/* user ^ has been banned for hate speech */	
	WHAT! HATE SPEECH? ARE YOU *(%&ING KIDDING ME??	
	yeahhhhhh so mod, that's literally a cartoon picture of a frog with four barely english words on it. you know that right? you're going to call that HATE SPEECH?	
o	ALRIGHT Y'ALL, i really hoped this would start out better... :sweat-smile: come on, this isn't /3/portapottylove (lolz). healthcare is for real. if you're in this thread i know you know how hard it can be. how can we make it better for people?	
	still can't get over someone being BANNED for posting a MEME	
d	yeah how are we going to actually figure out hard shit like making healthcare better if we can't get LITERALLY SIX REPLIES into a chat conversation without CENSORSHIP??	
a	hey everyone. i'm new to this thread and to this community, so i'm a little shy to post, but i just feel like this is such a safe and supportive space, i'm going to put myself out there and hope for the best. :scared:	
	maybe don't post then if you're going to whine about it the whole time

a	i'm one of the hundreds of millions of people whose lives have been impacted by the terrible tragedy of cancer. for me, it happened early, in my twenties. and it hit close to home: my dad.	
	hoo boy, tearjerker coming, i'm outtie	
	hey now, let's have some respect. cancer really sucks.	
	not as hard as your mom sucked last night	
	^ level 0 trolling, keep that shit outta here, we're trying to have a real conversation	
	^ level 0 white-knight'ing, stop boring me	
a	uh...i'll just keep going. it was prostate cancer, and yes, believe me that i know that men are supposed to start getting screened regularly for it when they hit 50. and no, my dad was most definitely NOT going to those screenings.	
	uhh, sounds like he was an idiot? how is the healthcare system supposed to prevent that...?	
	yeah sounds like you belong over in /3/education	
	or /3/whinylittlebitches	
a	okay you know what, never mind. this clearly isn't the place i thought it was.	
	nooooo wait! i really wanted to hear what you had to say :sad:	
	^ why, so you can get off on it? because i'm right there with you, now i'm sitting here with this half chubby wondering what porn site to take this to	
	ewww gross, why the eff would you GET OFF on somebody's story about their DAD DYING FROM CANCER??	
	yeah wtf man, that's pretty messed up	
	PEOPLE! don't feed the trolls. they're just trying to distract from the real issues here, and i'm sad to say that so far they're winning	
	yeah come on y'all, let's take it back to HEALTHCARE	
	:applause: hear hera	
b	okay so i'm gonna talk up something that i care a lot about and i think would be a great idea here in newtopia: community health centers	
b	i'll put a definition out there: "A Community Health Center - or CHC - is a not-for-profit, consumer-directed health care organization that provides access to affordable healthcare."	
	omg no way. those don't work at alllllllllll	
	^ yeah, i saw a study from a couple years ago that found this one community health center wasted TONS of government money to give, like, barely any actual healthcare to a handful of inner-city junkies	
	tons of TAXPAYER money you mean	
d	^^^^^ this is the real point here! wake up sheeple! obviously we gotta give healthcare to people who *legitimately* need it. but healthcare today is a SCAM designed to funnel MY HARD-EARNED TAX DOLLARS to some random DRUG ADDICTS who would rather get high than keep their babies alive!!!	
b	uhh...i think you all are way off base here	
b	i'm honestly not even sure where to start	
d	then DON'T, just FINISH already and let's all move on to talking about real solutions!	
	yeah, like, there are good points being made on all sides here. all we gotta do is figure out how to compromise between them	
c	well, here's a modest proposal: how about we build some kind of community health centers (i guess we should let <username_b> give us some details about what that'll actually look like, but whatever, i think we all basically get it for the purposes of this discussion). then, we can make it so that only people who *legitimately* need healthcare can get access. right?	
	YAAASSSS this man gets it!!	
	i love how obvious it is to you that the poster is a "man"...	
	^ obvious bitch	
	:joy: :joy: :joy:	
c	how can we tell if people legitimately need access? well, we kinda can't, right? it's too much overhead to really dig in to every individual case and figure out whether the person had some kind of accident outside of their control, or if they're just some welfare queen abusing food stamps	
d	EXACTLY, couldn't have said it better myself! and we obviously can't set things up for those welfare queens to just waltz on in and get their FREE HEALTHCARE ON MY DOLLAR, or they'll just learn that it works and suddenly they'll all be doing it.	
	^ "they" who, exactly...?	
c	anyway! i say we pick something objective that we can look at that will tell us whether somebody is _probably_ legit vs _probably_ trying to game the system. and what better thing to look for than whether those people are holding down a paying job?	
	:shocked-face-with-exploding-head: IT'S BRILLIANT	
	oooooh. i'm intrigued :thinking-face:	
c	i get that some people have reasons for not being able to hold a job, so we can maybe make some exceptions for really legitimate cases, like people with no legs or whatever. but we can't make too many exceptions, because they'll just figure out how to game the system.	
d	hmmm. i'll have to think about this more but you JUST MIGHT be on to something here.
