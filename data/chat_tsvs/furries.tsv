	tell us about how you met your husband!
	it's actually a really funny story! so, I was looking for parking on the first day of the convention, and all of the sudden I got rear-ended! I look  in the front seat of the car that hit me, and it's actually a fox! not just any fox either, but a ridiculously handsome fox :heart_eyes: anyway, after we exchanged insurance info, we spent the rest of the convention hanging out, and the rest is  history!
