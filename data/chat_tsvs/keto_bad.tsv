	I asked my boss if I could count keto flu days as sick days, and she said yes. So I just take a few sick days a week tbh
	lazy much?
	look I dunno why you guys are complaining - i haven't gotten keto flu since the first week. just stop cheating and it won't  happen
	stfu
	:bread-smack: :curse-you-with-carbs:
	Mods, didn't we used to ban idiots like this?
	ugh, so key to be working in a place that understands different lifestyle choices :praying-hands:
a	Speaking of which, advice time! I wanted my kids to be keto, right? I mean, obviously I want what's best for them, and there is so much research showing that keto is the healthiest possible diet.
	Like, clearly we all know this because we're here
mod	/* user ^ has created a new emoji! :lady-gaga-bacon-dress: */
a	Ok but the problem is, my son's school *refuses* to acknowledge that this is a thing. They literally forced him to eat mashed potatoes yesterday!
	holy shit
	:gasp:
	are you serious!?
	Yes.
	Are you in the PTA? Go to the next meeting and speak up about this. That's really not okay. This is clearly discrimination. I don't see them making any vegetarian kids eat meat.
	yeah like, what in the actual fuck
	rights for ketos!!!!
	dude going to a PTA meeting is not enough. call this shit out on twitter, go to the NYT or s/th
b	wait, what's your kids school name? :evil-grin:
a	he just goes to Newtopia middle
b	tnx bro, I got you
a	?
	one sec
mod	/* user ^ has created a new emoji! :bacon-pants: */
b	are you ready for this
b	I just swatted them
	efffffff yessssssssss
a	wait what the whole school? MY KID IS THERE YOU MORON
b	no, chill out, just the principal's house
	:muscle-bacon: :avocado: :gun:
	nice1

	swat their carb ass !@
	wait whos the principle ?
	my hero!! :bacon-eyes: :jesus-on-bacon-cross:
c	Hey /3/keto !!! So happy to be here
	welcome to the party :bacon-martini:
	in accordance with our guidelines, please upload a photo of your pee stick box
c	sorry, what?
	your pee stick box
	you do use keto pee strips to test whether you're in keto right?
c	Oh, those, yes? Or, I have a couple times.
	lolol that's not nearly enough, you gota test every day man
	yeah so when you test where do you put the sticks
c	...in the trash?
	wtf man
	?!?!?!?!?!????
	no you have to get a box
	SAVAGE
	were you raised by barn animals bro
	gross you put them in the trash!?
c	Wait, why would I want to put them in a box though?
	you ask a lot of questions for a noob
	:bacon-chair-flip:
	do u even take cold showers?
	TBH I don't think most people here take cold showers. Not naming names, but I know for a fact several people on here say they do but then they don't
	wwoooowwww, what a bunch of fucking posers
	I take cold showers. 5m a day
	I do 7m
	You know what they say about people who call out posers--they're the real poser
	if you're not taking cold showers every day (at least 5m) with a jicama enema 1x/wk, you literally can't even get into keto. like do whatever you want but you'll never get into keto unless you follow the protocol
	where did all these fake keto bitches come from anyway
	I also found out, if you do anal kegels with the jicama insert it's more effective
	honestly how do you not accidentally do anal kegels in the cold shower amirite :cry-bacon-tears:
	no homo
	if you're a woman, is the enema more effective when done vaginally?
	I dunno, can you send a pic of the vagina in question? This merits further analysis.
	Oh hey girl, what's up :bacon-dick:
	:thumbs-up-skintone-2:
	DUDE wtf, why do you have to use the skintone hand? Just use the regular fucking yellow hand like everybody else.
	like what are you trying to say
	YELLOW IS A NEUTRAL COLOR. YELLOW IS NO SKIN TONE. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BRING RACE POLITICS INTO THIS BY USING A SKIN TONE AT ALL.
	shots fires
	fired*
	lolol
	I mean like what, do you want the blue hand next?
	go fucking join the portapotties thread if you love blue so much
	yellow is the color of butter which we shall worship as our god
	ALL MUST BOW TO THE COLOR YELLOW
