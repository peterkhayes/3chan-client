a	Ok, so, normally I wouldn't say this to anyone
	go on
a	but like, I just feel really safe with you guys, you know?
a	I mean, you all*
a	sorry, didn't mean to not be inclusive!
	It's okay!
a	Ok but back to my secret~
	yessss
	tell usssss
a	Well...
a	the thing is....
a	I REALLY LOVE PORTAPOTTIES. It's almost sexual how much I love them.
	omg (!!!!)
a	(ok plz don't judge me)
	you've got to be kidding
	me too!
a	wait what
	Like, one of the biggest reasons I go to Take3 stuff and other festivals is because I love using portapotties
	omg SAME
	wtf omg I can't believe this :joy-cry: I have found my people!
	Ok so I love the color blue they are. It's like, the perfect shade of blue.
	YAAAASSSSSS
	It looks like the blue they use in diaper commercials to represent pee
	It's just so deep and so blue. The bluest blue. Like a crayon.
	you know maybe this is the thing for me too, i've been collecting blue crayons. sometimes I smell them
	Ok, confession. I had sex in a portapottie once and I came. So. Hard.
	I've been trying to get my partner to have portapottie sex and they said maybe, but in that way that probably means no :ugly-cry:
	It's the best.
	Wait...has like everybody in here had portapottie sex but me :sad-face:
	no
	yes? :innocent:
	tell me everythinggggggg
	yeah it's like really small in there, so you can put your body parts all against everything and get some solid positions going
	ahhhh don't rub it innnnn :bawling:
	my fave is the spiderman lol
	this ^
	wait what is that like where you're upside down?
	more like, spread out and holding yourself up in the air with your feet and your hands
	lol the game is--just don't fall in
	...why don't you just close the lid?
	I mean, yeah, I could, but that's what makes it so exciting
	sikkk :get-it-grl:
	:kamasutra:
	ok so I love how small they are in there. It's like a closet...but SMALLER
	It almost makes me wanna take a book in there and read
	y beach read when you could portapottie read :hairflip:
	wait how did we stop talking about p-sex because that was pretty :fire:
	I just wanna say, I've never felt so liberated
	what do you mean?
	yeah!
	:liberace-smoking-cigarette:
	^ nice 1
	:laughing:
	I just feel really accepted
	awww!
	:heart-eyes:
	It's like, none of us care what anybody else is or wants to do
	we can all totally be ourselves, no judgment
	sorry, not trying to troll but legit asking--isn't it judgement?
	no, webster's accepts both
	ah ok, nvm!
	but yes! I feel the same way
	question time
	would anybody ever get married in a portapottie?
	how would that even work
	my friend totally did this. they eloped tho...not sure if they even told their parents the truth??
	wait---should we all get matching "I :heart: portapotty" mugs from cafe press????!!!!!!! 
	yassss
	that's how we'll spot each other in public!
	last night, I dreamed I was in a portapotty and it was mega hot :heart-eyes:
	was it all yellow? :music-notes:
	yay I ordered my mug! can't wait to spot you all in the cafe ~
	I got one for me and my partner!!!
	these are so cute!
	okay I don't know if this is controversial here or not, but tbh one of my fave things about using portapotties is the challenge. Like I find myself wearing these really elaborate costumes to festivals just so I can prove to myself - I can portapotty in any costume you throw at me. Full on glitter bodysuit? Done it, without crotch zipper. Wings? 2' wingspan, no problem.
	I never thought aobut it before btu I think that's it for me too - I really get off on challenges
	i just rly like the way they smell.. like not the poop smell obvi but the plastic itself...
	yeah, I do like that smell. It's almost like a new car smell, but different. A smell that is distinctly portapotty
