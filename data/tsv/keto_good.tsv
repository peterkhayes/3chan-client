	I :clap-skintone-3: HAVE :clap-skintone-3: BEEN :clap-skintone-3: WAITING :clap-skintone-3: FOR :clap-skintone-3: THIS :clap-skintone-3: THREAD
	:bacon: :bacon: :bacon:
	wait what there's a bacon emoji?!
	:bacon:
	I hereby declare bacon the official currency of /3/keto
	:bacon: :bacon: :bacon: :bacon: :bacon: :bacon:
	rich ^
	guys serious question--
	abs
	 'abs' as in absolutely, or as in the ripped af abs you get from doing keto :wink:
	:the-hulk-doing-crunches:
	I'm getting into this low carb thing for the first time, and I am dedd. how maek brian wrk plz keto flu is killing me
	softly?
	with hiiiiis song :music-notes:
	I asked my boss if I could count keto flu days as sick days, and she said yes. So I just take a few sick days a week tbh
	ugh, so key to be working in a place that understands different lifestyle choices :praying-hands:
a	Speaking of which, advice time! I wanted my kids to be keto, right? I mean, obviously I want what's best for them, and there is so much research showing that keto is the healthiest possible diet, etc etc you guys get it.
	Yeah, I feel you
	:bacon: :bacon: :bacon:
a	Ok but the problem is, my son's school *refuses* to acknowledge that this is a thing. They literally forced him to eat mashed potatoes yesterday!
	classic school mistake
	so sorry to hear that :sad:
	well, we have to educate people. keto just isn't mainstream enough. What if you set up a 1-1 meeting with his teacher, and in the meantime packed his lunch every day?
	So there's this keto meal delivery service I ab-so-lute-ly love. It's called Bravocado: https://www.bravocado.com
	A little bit expensive per meal - but so worth it
	Best. Name. Ever. I can't tell if it's bacon + avocado or bravo + avocado or both but I don't care

	you HAVE to try the keto breakfast smoothie! it's literally just blended steak and coconut oil
	:drool:
	do they have a pet plan? my vet said I have to put my cat on a diet...
	wait, aren't cats already keto?
	who knows what's in mass-produced cat food tbh, probably cardboard
	Is cardboard keto tho?
	hm....good q - isthisketo.com doesn't recognize cardboard
	just pour melted butter over it and its probably fine
	can we just take a second to talk about the foods we miss though
	noooooo :hand-over-ears: I don't think I can handle the temptation
	ok so like does anybody else just like not even eat vegetables at all even green ones because your so scared of going over your carbs ?
	:look-left: :look-right: ??
	No, I would die without broccoli dipped in grass fed ghee. That is like basically my dessert every day
	um i'm pretty sure you have to keep eating vegetables, where else do you get fiber from
	lol cardboard it sounds like

	does anybody have a favorite ketone pee stick? I like to check my levels now and then - feels hard to calibrate macros sometimes
	I like ketostix! www.amazon.com/Ketostix-Reagent-Strips-100-Count-Box/
	"I check my ketone levels via pee strip maybe a few times a week because I'm paranoid.

confession: afterwards, for some reason at some point I started throwing them into this box, and then I never threw them out, and now I have a shoebox under my bed filled with like 2 yrs of used pee sticks"
	...um
	wut
	wait other people do this
	so you have a pee stick box?
	omg I do that too!
	WOW
	:bacon: :bacon: :wet:
	doesn't that, like, smell?
	that is a lot of pee man
	I can't smell it, but you know, could be one of those things like how you can't smell your own BO
	I can definitely smell my own BO
	mine smells a little when I open it I guess? but you can't smell it closed. I keep my pee stick box in my closet, maybe that's why. Under the bed is bold.
	Hey /3/keto !!! So happy to be here
	Welcome! :bacon:
	:bacon:
	:avocado: :bacon:
	sorry if this is a noob question, but I have a hardcore keto friend who told me that jicama suppositories will help you get into keto faster?
	I've done it and didn't notice a huge difference for me personally, but it is a legit thing
	actually, these work great for me - I think a lot of people just don't realize you have to do it in a cold shower
	do you all take cold showers every day? I've heard those are great for generating higher levels of brown fat, but like a hot shower in the morning is one of those simple pleasures in life I don't know if I can give up
	I would say, the freezing shower is hard at first, but then you get used to it and it's kind of nice. I def can tell I burn more calories now.
	And the more calories you burn, the more steak you can eat :heart-eyes:
