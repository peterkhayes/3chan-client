	yo yo hey poly people!
	so glad I found this thread~
	Same - I've been running my own poly blog for years, it's so nice to have a community *I* can ask questions to
	Ugh yeah, it's hard to always have to be the expert in the room
a	So last night, I went out on the worst date. He said he was poly beforehand, over and over. And then during dinner he was all like, "So my gf and I really are looking for someone who's into both of us..."
	Christ give me a break

	What a trope. Did you tell him to go get his unicorns from Toys R Us like everybody else.
	Honey, noooooo, that suxx
a	lol I wish I would have thought of that in the moment
b	Ok so I have a question
b	How soon is too soon to share a calendar with someone?
b	Because I've been on one date with this guy, and we're trying to plan our second, and it's already soooo harrrdddd to schedule. It'd be so much easier if we could just see each others calendar rite
	I went out with a woman yesterday who sent me a cal invite for our first date and I was basically like - so when's our wedding b/c ur my soulmate
	There should be a name for this phase of the relationship
	what about Gcal bonded
	Schedule-bonded?
	"Baby...can I insert you into my....calendar?"
	I just came
	tmi?
	don't schedule-bond before you fluid-bond
	^ I think you got that backwards
	It's such a turn-on when I get a cal invite for the first date
	Also who else loves it when their partners are so proactive about communication ~~~
	I was on OkC the other day and this person messaged me (not the first message, it was like our 4th) all like, "So I really hope this isn't too forward, but I wanted to let you know I'm into kink just in case."
	awww!
	Did you reply that filtering for "poly" is basically the same as filtering for "into kink" because that's been my experience
	yeah, I noticed that! The other day I was like--wow, I haven't been with a non-kinky person in years
	So I am secretly dying to share a happy moment!
	do itttttt

	It was this ^ except all my partners were hanging out together just as friends
	"holy shit my heart is literally melting stopppp

(but actually don't, more details!!!!!!)"
	Well I dunno, it's just like, when you first get into polyamory, you wonder whether this will ever actually work. And then your partners all become bffs and even hang out without you and it's so frecking cute you want to curl into a ball and die of cute overload happy thoughts all at once and you realize - this is everything you've ever wanted in life
	I am so so happy for you all!!
	:teddy-bear-trio:
	waaaaaaaa!!!!! Can we like start a Polycules Photos Phriday???
	YAASSSS plz plz plz
	"I also have happy news ~

I married one gorgeous and supportive partner almost 5 years ago. And today, I proposed to another love of my life. They said yes!!!!!"
	awwwwww!
	so much good news today!
	:trio-of-hearts: :hugs:
	What's the wedding plan? Are you going to go full-on wedding, or small commitment ceremony style?
	We still have to talk about it. I'm thinking small commitment ceremony? But, my parents aren't super on board. I don't really know what to do about that part.
	Oh no, sorry to hear about the parents. That sounds really rough. I'm lucky my parents are basically hippies so they get it.
	Here's hoping the rest of your family comes around and sees that true love and support can be held strongly between more than two people!
	So will you wear two rings?
	Haha I guess so!
	#doubleStacked
	Poly problems: "Sorry sweetheart, I'd love to marry you too, but my wedding ring finger is completely full. Maybe I could get a pinky ring?"
	lol~
	Speaking of parents, I've been thinking a lot about coming out to mine. Any advice? I don't expect them to react well. :sad:
	When I came out to my parents, they had a hard time understanding that it wasn't an affair situation, and that everybody was informed and happy. Maybe having everybody in the room as you explain is one way to prevent this?
	Well, you also may not want to give your parents big hard news with a stranger in the room.
	true
	You could try telling your parents first, and then scheduling a lunch date with everyone involved soon after?
	yeah, this is all great advice! I'm super nervous...
	You can do this! We're all here for you!

	Is monosexual polyromantic a thing? Bc I think thatâ€™s me
	Yes. Now, go off into the world and be your true, amazing, awesome self!
	The word monosexual usually means that you are either straight or gay (not bi or pan).
	"Hey lovers, Please sign my petition. Lets see which country has the biggest amount of supporters for this inevitable step for marriages! <3

	Mods, is this a spam post? Like, I want it to be real, but it looks shady af
mod	/* user ^ has been banned for spam posting */
c	"ok so like I'm curious how you all handle group cooking when everybody has different dietary requirements?

my gf is paleo but my bf is vegan and I really don't know how to make this work..."
	That's a tough one--you want to be inclusive of everybody and make special dinners for both your partners, I really feel your struggle <3
	yeah, I mean, I feel like the only advice I have is the obvious advice - make a lot of dishes per meal, half that are vegan and half that aren't
	does the vegan partner get offended when you cook meat?
c	I think they'd prefer I didn't, but also, what can you do
d	hey efvery one--in search of support right now :sad:
	oh no, what's wrong?
	we're here for you!!
	:hugs:
d	just found out my partner watched "our show" together with their new partner...I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but feeling so hurt and betrayed......
	Oh no, wow, yeah, tbh I would be really hurt too. Shows are a big deal!
e	yeah, I'm sure your partner didn't mean any harm, but I also really feel your pain. You cultivate special couple shows and it feels like a little island you have for just you two, and then someone else treads on that island and you realize - holy shit, I'm sharing this life with another person, my island is overrun by tourists
	^ not sure if "overrun by tourists" is the best metaphor? but yes agree with the sentiment
e	yeah you're right, sorry, hopefully the thread knows what I mean
