	Who tf was this guy
	His name is __________ and his partner is __________, tell all your friends, seriously , completely toxic people in this community
	grosssss
	are they in this chat? Mods, ban them!
	I mean like, why didn't you ask him about his relationship style before going on the date? It sounds like you just didn't do your research, this kind of on you tbh
	speaking of bitches ^
	:eyeroll:
	Well thanks for telling me who it is, I'm uninviting them from all future poly happy hours and all poly events
	y can't we just kick them out of newtopia
	this ^
	I'm about to make a public facebook post. They will be named-and-shamed!!
	Send them outside in the cold with the bears!!!!!
	i hope they get eaten
a	tha'ts nothing,   my wife was knocked up by her bf & tried to hide it
	holy shit, tell us the whole story
a	ok, here goes. This is gonna be a long one
a	We became Poly, well she calls it Poly, I call it; an open marriage, as this was her idea, not mine. Previously, we've had our fun with Unicorns and threesomes with women, so I knew this day would come. The day she wanted more.... I agreed to it, she found a boyfriend, I found a girlfriend, it was fun.
a	But then she fell in LOVE w/ him... I was always handling the kids while she's out banging.... Ugh.... I never would find used condoms after the fact, like EVER, she would tell me he takes em' home; which is REALLY fucking odd. But whatever, although I could sometimes smell the latex off of her. NOTE: I always used protection.
a	Moving forward.... I noticed her last period was a bit of a joke, and she was less bitchy. So I started looking for preggo tests that we may have had left from last baby. My plan was to test yer pee, she never flushes... But then.... Low and behold, I find 3 different preggo tests kinds under the sink, all taken and all positive!
a	She says a condom broke, she's 35 like WTF, tell me and get Plan B .... Ugh I dunno.... Advice?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
	wwwoooooowwwwwww
	lolol "he took the condoms home" WHAT a lying BITCH,, I can't believe you fell for that
	Run. But before you do that, start documenting EVERYTHING! Set yourself up for success by keeping quiet, doing what you need to do for you and keeping very clear documentation for courts.
	Your wife isn't poly, she's a cheater. You've done nothing wrong here, save perhaps giving her enough rope to hang herself with.
	Well, to be honest, it seems like there was a severe communicatino break down on both sides here? You were clearly unhappy for a long time and the two of you never talked about it...
	all bow down to the know-it-all Perfect Polyamorist here ^
	I thought poly was *supposed* to be about frequent and honest communication
	rly bcuz I'm mostly here for the 3somes
	the word "amor" is literarally in the name, wtf
	i exclusively have 5somes b/c 3s are kind of boring to me now and 4 is an even number so you just end up in pairs

	"polyamory" means you love other people, "swinging" means you bang them like soul-less objects
	(25M) New to polyamory with a woman (27F). Could use advice and support. Plz contact me , lonelyman@yahoo.com
	:eyeroll:
	so do you guys have any strategies for improving communication?
	dunno if you ever lurk /3/keto but I think the steak and butter smoothie recipe they have on the sidebar makes me a a much better communicator. Not sure why, I just get this buzz from it
	maybe your butter is laced with molly ?
	take this over to /3/druglegalization and keep it off our channel please, this is a family-friendly space
	I like B12 and fish oil for this, both improve brain function, also me and all my partners start our checkins with a bulletproof coffee
	ANNOUNCEMENT: As everyone in this community knows, we take our Poly Values very seriously. As such, I'm terribly sad to announce that I saw someone in this community on a 1-1 date this week. As you all know, this is Monogamous Behavior and will not be tolerated. This user has been kindly asked to leave /3/polyamory
	!!!!!!!!!
	scandalous
	Who is it!?!?!?
	We can totally figure this out - I'm throwing together a script right now that will parse the archived member list from yesterday and compare it to today's

	wow you know she kidn of loks like a bitch if im being honest...
d	hey efvery one--in search of support right now :sad:
	ill show you support baby :wink:
	...what "clever" line were you hoping to follow that with? "with my DICK" :eyeroll:
	oh no, what's wrong? :hugs:
d	just found out my partner watched "our show" together with their new partner...I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but feeling so hurt and betrayed......
	Oh no, wow, yeah, tbh I would be really hurt too. Shows are a big deal!
	sorry I don't understand what you're mad about. They....looked at a tv with another partner and you're upset now?
	I totally get it - You cultivate special couple shows and it feels like a little island you have for just you two, and then someone else treads on that island and you realize - holy shit, I'm sharing this life with another person, my private island has no space for just us anywhere
	well, if your poly, you just have to learn to get over that. you have to put yourself below not only our own relationship, but every relationship in the polycule. being poly means you lose yourself in some ways, that's just how it is hon
