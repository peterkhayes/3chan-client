We can say that we want a centralized authority to pay for it, which, great. I'm in favor. But also, those resources have to come from somewhere, and eventually we're going to have to make choices.

I'd actually like to propose something more like this. Have you all heard of unschooling? It's like Montessori meets homeschooling. That way, parents get to decide how their kids are taught.
