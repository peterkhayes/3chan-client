  "The only way to fix something is to break it. Smash it to the point where it can no longer function. Not because it needs to be broken to make it better, but because you hate it, it was not your idea anyway. Breaking it with the wrath of your valid emotions will be the litmus test, because the only thing that really matters is how you feel.",
  "Pour your pain gently into the maw of someone who wishes you loved them. Allow it to linger on their lips until it wanders off, spreading your side of the story faster than anyone else’s. Don’t stop until it’s slithered through the hearts and fists and mouths of 1000 strangers. Their outrage will be your salvation.",
  "You’ve waited so long for this. None of them have waited as long as you have. They will eagerly move aside to let you go first, once they understand what you’ve been through lately. Whisper stolen secrets and thank them with a cascade of perfectly formed teardrops, each more exquisite than the last. Their opinion of you will be forever changed.",

  "Congratulations, you’ve wormed your way into the secret innards circle. The ecstatic memory of bleach and razors sears your scalp and you’ve finally perfected that truly enigmatic gaze",
  "To escape the echoing chamber of mediocrity you must be brave and chaotic. Discard your former self and dig your claws into something precious. Don’t just twist it, tear it until snaps it in two.",
  "Destroy with careful design and dismantle in a way that will resonate for days or weeks or years. Dial up misguided hope and serve out bitter disappointment until at least one room full of hearts is truly broken.",
  "This is the way to make your mark. To be the one they talk about. The one who was daring and dangerous and didn’t follow the rules. Every time they gather, they will recount the legend of you.So unfair, the way you were treated that time. You know the time I’m talking about, but we can’t name names. Or can we?",
  "Take another. No one is looking. If you don’t take it first, someone else will. And who knows what they’ll do with it? In fact, why don’t you take three?",
  "Step a little closer. Closer. They won’t mind. Until you get too close. It’s so hard to know where too close is, isn’t it? Never mind, just stay away from everyone.",
  "Relax. Breathe deeply, and inhale the fumes of the disastrous ideas you’ve spawned today. It will only make you stronger.",

  "Whenever you speak from now on, preface each sentence with “I’m an artist.” They need to know.",
  "Just walk away. It’s too long, it’s boring, and you have better things to do. They won’t even notice you’re gone.",
  "Nothing can truly grow until we begin planting seeds of doubt.",
